              My name is Brainard Ordo√±a, a Web Developer. I am skilled in front
              end web development. I have great skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript,

              a Customer Representative for 1 year.As a VA I managed multiple

              {" "}
              I decided to shift my career as a Web Developer because my dream
              was to become a developer. I am an undergrad in BSIT but this will
              not stop me to pursue my dream to be a developer. I used every
              resources to learn the fundamentals in front end development like
              google, youtube, udemey and etc. I am confident that I am ready to
              be part of a company/team and be a great employee/teammate.
